## 🧑‍💻 Who I Am

I'm a backend and DevOps developer with over 5 years of experience building scalable web applications, APIs, and deployment pipelines. I enjoy solving real-world problems with clean code, reliable systems, and efficient infrastructure. Most of my work revolves around Django, Express, Docker, and making things run smoothly behind the scenes.
